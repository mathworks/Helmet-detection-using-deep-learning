Deep learning object detection technology is sometimes used for people detection in images.

People detection are very common in Automated driving system. In addition, it is also used at factories and workplaces.
They check the behavior of worker or if workers wear necessary equipment in hazardous areas.

this file is a sample code that trains an object detection model (Yolo v2) with labeled video data to detect a man wearing or not wearing helmets.
